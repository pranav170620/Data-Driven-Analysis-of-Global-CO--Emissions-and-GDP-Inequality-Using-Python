# Data-Driven Analysis of Global CO₂ Emissions and GDP Inequality Using Python
This project investigates global carbon emissions using real-world data from Our World in Data. It explores trends in CO₂ emissions across income groups, identifies top-emitting countries over time, and visualizes the relationship between GDP and per capita emissions. Additionally, it examines how global wealth inequality has shifted over decades through distribution analysis of GDP per capita.

Using Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this notebook demonstrates the power of visual analytics in uncovering patterns in socio-environmental data — a critical skill for any data analyst aiming to influence policy, sustainability, or business strategy through data-driven insights.
